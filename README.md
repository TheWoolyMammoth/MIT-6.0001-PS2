## Change Log:
* __05/10/2021__: created the three helper functions *is_word_guessed()*,*get_guessed_word*,*get_available_letters()*. Also implemented test functions to test the list
* __05/12/2021__: worked on hangman.py functin, have not tested. created another function called *is_in_word()* that looks for the user guess and returns true or false depending on if it is in the word or not. also started working on another function called punishment for handling point reductions unsure if it will be implemented.  
* __05/13/2021__: finished the hangman function and tested it using my test values, and the randomizer. added a function caled *unique_letters()* that calculates the number of unique letters in the secret word. this is used in calculating the users points.
